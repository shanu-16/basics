## Work Permit ##
You can find out about the process for work permit here http://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Working-in-Sweden/Employed/How-to-apply.html

The steps are as follows
- You are about to get a job offer from a Swedish employer and you are a non EU citizen. The first thing you should ask your employer is if they have hired people from outside of EU. (You don't need to ask this if it is obvious that they have). If they have not then you should ask them if they know about the process of work permit is. You will be surprised how many employer don't know any thing about hiring from outside of EU. They assume you can just start working.

- You should ask that you are give an offical Migrationsveket offer of employment. Some one from your future company's HR  can create offer of employment (using the Migrationsverket website and their personal Mobile bank id so they can digitall sign the offer). They can  and also get opnion from the union
 
- It would be easier if your company hires a relocation company (since they are experts at creating job offers and other things involved). Usually it saves the employer quite some work. It is always the employer who pays for hiring relocation company.  The relocation company (if you trust them) can also have your power of attorney and file your part of the application as well. It seems that using relocation company can lead to faster results. Some large companies are certified themselves and don't need relocation companies.(they must be doing 20+ applications in a year to do so)
 
- The job has to be advertised in https://www.arbetsformedlingen.se/. It should be a fairly recent advertisment. Make sure that your occupation title and duties match this advertisement. This ad will also show up in other EU countries. The Ads go away after a while so make sure it is recent so you can check it your self (and take a screenshot/copy) just in case. The Ad has to be there for 10 days (to be safe call it 10 working days).

- If the employer is part of a Swedish collective agreement then you don't have to demand any thing extra, but if they are not then you MUST ask them to provide you with all insurances required for your work permit from day 1. Does not matter if you are probation or company does not have policy. No insurances, no deal. This should be part of your contract. If company say that they will follow some policy then you say that they have to be explicit in your contract. Don't budge on this.

- Your salary per month will be based on your employer and your skill level etc. But you can compare some average salaries in http://www.lonestatistik.se/. 
 
- You may not be able to get insurnace before you come to Sweden. It may not be possible to get them right after you start as well since you will not have person number from day 1. But after you come to Sweden and start your job you have 3 months (You can perhaps have that as a part of your contract as well that provided Skattaverket issues you are person number you will be enrolled in all insurances that are promised in offer of employment)

- You should get your occupational pension which is 4.5% of your base monthly salary. Make sure that it is paid from the first day you work. This is the middle part of the pension pyramid http://www.spv.se/en/About-your-pensions/How-pensions-work/. Don't agree to loan exchange or any undeclared policy about pension. It should be crystal clear in your contract what kind of pension you will get. If it is a plan like ITP then you can check the terms of that on ITP website.

- You should also clarify to your employer that any terms of employment have to be notified in written. This includes change in salary, change in occupation. Failure to do so may result in problems for you.

- Your employer should know that there is no gurantee that your work permit will be approved before a certain time. Alot depends upon your employer (they could hire a relocation company to make process more predictable).

- You should in your contract specify that upon your request while you are employed or upto 4 years the company is obligated to provide you letters to help you secure further work permit extension (free of any charge) to certify that you worked for them in XYZ occupation and information about your salaries , pensions and insurances. This letter will be used for your Migrationsverket procedures.

- Failure to honor agreements (i.e not paying salaries on time, not paying insurances on time, not notifying change of company businesses etc) by your employer can risk your chances of permanent residence or further extensions. It is advised that you include a clause that if failure on employer part results on your deportation then the employer has to pay some sort of damages (i.e cost of flight back to your home country for example, because clearly they fucked up)

- Once you have the work permit documents then you can file for your part of the application.

## After the permit is approved

- For first two years you have to work in the same occupation with the same company. Your company is the one that will show up as the one paying you in KU10 form.

- Once it is time for extension you need to show KU10 forms for the years you have been employed. Each employer files this by the end of the year. This form shows who paid you which company paid you how much money in a particular year. 

- You will also need other documentation to support that you had insurances paid every month and your occupation was the same
 
- You should join a Union and A-kassa. Look them up what they are.

- Make sure that when you are switching company or the occupation, the job is advertised and you follow the same procedures as before about insurances and salaries.
