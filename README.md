## Work Permit ##
You can find out about the process for work permit here http://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Working-in-Sweden/Employed/How-to-apply.html

The steps are as follows
 - You are about to get a job offer from a Swedish employer and you are a non EU citizen. The first thing you should ask your employer is if they have hired people from outside of EU. (You don't need to ask this if it is obvious that they have). If they have not then you should ask them if they know about the process of work permit is.
 - You should also ask if the employer is hiring a relocation company to start process from their side. Some one responsible from that company can create offer of employment and also get opnion from the union, but it would be easier if they hire a relocation company (since they are experts at this). Usually it saves the employer some work and it has to be the employer who pays for it. The relocation company (if you trust them) can also have your power of attorney and file your part of the application as well. 
- The job has to be advertised in https://www.arbetsformedlingen.se/. It should be a fairly recent advertisment. Make sure that your occupation title and duties match this advertisement. This ad will also show up in other EU countries. The Ads go away after a while so make sure it is recent so you can check it your self (and take a screenshot/copy) just in case. The Ad has to be there for 10 days (to be safe call it 10 working days).
 - If the employer is part of a Swedish collective agreement then you don't have to demand any thing extra, but if they are not then you MUST ask them to provide you with all insurances required for your work permit from day 1. Does not matter if you are probation or company. This should be part of your contract. If company say that they will follow some policy then you say that they have to be explicit in your contract. Don't budge on this.
 - You may not be able to get insurnace before you come to Sweden. But after you come to Sweden and start your job you have 3 months (You can perhaps have that as a part of your contract as well that provided Skattaverket issues you are person number you will be enrolled in all insurances that are promised in offer of employment)
 - You should get your occupational pension which is 4.5% of your base monthly salary. Make sure that it is paid from the first day you work.
 - You should also clarify to your employer that any terms of employment have to be notified in written. This includes change in salary, change in occupation
 - Your employer should know that there is no gurantee that your work permit will be approved before a certain time. Alot depends upon your employer (they could hire a relocation company to make process more predictable).
 - You should in your contract specify that upon your request while you are employed and upto 4 years of your employment the company is responsible to certify that you worked for them in XYZ occupation and information about your salaries , pensions and insurances. This letter will be used for your Migrationsverket procedures.
 - Failure to honor agreements (i.e not paying salaries on time, not paying insurances on time, not notifying change of company businesses etc) by your employer can risk your chances of permanent residence or further extensions. I would also like to include a clause that if failure on employer part results on your deportation then the employer has to pay some sort of damages (i.e flight back to your home country, because clearly they fucked up)
 - Once you have the work permit documents then you can file for your part of the application.

After the permit is approved

 - For first two years you have to work in the same occupation with the same company. Your company is the one that will show up as the one paying you in KU10 form.
 - Once it is time for extension you need to show KU10 forms for the years you have been employed. Each employer files this by the end of the year. This form shows who paid you which company paid you how much money in a particular year. 
 - You will also need other documentation to support that you had insurances paid every month and your occupation was the same
